# EMG Explorer

A modular interface for signals visualization and processing

## Description

Filtering and having an overview of data are essential steps before feature extractions or any analytical process. This interface can provide a robust foundation to support this processing stage. The key word: modularity.

Built in the context of High Density Electromyography processing, this interface developed with PyQT, Pyqtgraph, Xarray/Datatree and Jinja, offers multi-channel visualizations in temporal and frequency domains. It enables users to generate reports with specific metrics, create and customize processing pipelines.  Designed to be as modular as possible, the interface allows users to incorporate their own features that fit their datasets by following a standardized code architecture.

## Getting Started
